## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/diffguardian.git
   cd diffguardian
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Aryan0628/diffguardian.git
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Version        |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Node.js    | >= 18          |
| npm        | >= 9           |
| Git        | Latest stable  |

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build WASM Grammars

The WASM grammar binaries are not checked into git. You must build them locally after cloning:

```bash
npm run build:grammars
```

This downloads `wasi-sdk` and compiles Tree-Sitter grammars for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, and Rust into WASM binaries in the `grammars/` directory.

### Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Type-check without emitting
npm run lint

# Run the test suite
npm test

# Run the CLI locally
npx dg --help
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Pick or Create an Issue

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/Aryan0628/diffguardian/issues) page for open items.
- If you want to work on something not listed, create an issue first to discuss scope and approach.
- Issues labeled `good first issue` are a great starting point for new contributors.

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

Use the following branch naming convention:

| Type          | Pattern           | Example                  |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Feature       | `feat/<name>`     | `feat/gitlab-reporter`   |
| Bug fix       | `fix/<name>`      | `fix/enum-tracing-crash` |
| Documentation | `docs/<name>`     | `docs/api-examples`      |
| Refactor      | `refactor/<name>` | `refactor/tracer-perf`   |
| Chore         | `chore/<name>`    | `chore/update-deps`      |

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Follow existing code style and patterns.
- Add tests for all new functionality.
- Update documentation when your changes affect the public API or user-facing behavior.

### 4. Verify Locally

Run the full verification suite before submitting:

```bash
# Lint — ensure no type errors
npm run lint

# Run the full test suite
npm test

# Build — ensure it compiles cleanly
npm run build

# Run a local sanity check
npx dg check
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

See the [Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process) section below.

## Writing Classification Rules

Classification rules are the core of Diff Guardian's analysis engine. Each rule is a single TypeScript file in `src/classifier/rules/`.

### Rule Template

```typescript
// src/classifier/rules/R99_your_rule.ts

import { FunctionRule, RuleResult } from "../types";

export const yourRule: FunctionRule = {
  id: "R99",
  name: "Your Rule Name",
  description: "What this rule detects and why it matters.",
  languages: "all", // or specify: ['typescript', 'python']
  target: "function", // 'function' | 'interface' | 'enum'

  check(oldSig, newSig): RuleResult | null {
    // Compare oldSig and newSig
    // Return null if no issue detected
    // Return a RuleResult if the rule fires

    return {
      severity: "breaking", // 'breaking' | 'warning'
      changeType: "signature_change",
      message: "Describe exactly what changed and why it matters.",
    };
  },
};
```

### Checklist for New Rules

Before submitting a new rule, ensure the following:

1. Assign the next available rule ID (`R29`, `R30`, etc.)
2. Create the rule file in `src/classifier/rules/`
3. Export it from `src/classifier/rules/index.ts`
4. Write tests covering both positive and negative cases
5. Document the rule in the README classification rules table
6. Validate with a real codebase using `npx dg compare`

---

## Adding Language Support

To add support for a new programming language:

1. **Install the Tree-Sitter grammar:**

   ```bash
   npm install tree-sitter-<language>
   ```

2. **Build the WASM binary:**
   Add the build command to the `build:grammars` script in `package.json`.

3. **Create a translator:**
   Add `src/parsers/translators/<language>.ts` implementing the signature extraction logic. Use an existing translator (e.g., `typescript.ts`) as a reference.

4. **Register the language** in `src/core/constants.ts` with its file extensions.

5. **Add tracer support** for import resolution patterns in `src/tracer/languages/`.

6. **Write tests** covering the new language's function, interface, and enum signatures.

---

## Testing

Diff Guardian uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as its test framework.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npx vitest --watch

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest tests/classifier.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
npx vitest --coverage
```

### Test Categories

| Category              | Scope                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit tests**        | Individual rules, translators, and utilities |
| **Integration tests** | Full pipeline with real git diffs            |
| **Snapshot tests**    | Reporter output format stability             |

### Test Pattern

Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";

describe("R01: Parameter Removed", () => {
  it("should flag when a required parameter is removed", () => {
    // Arrange: create before/after signatures
    // Act: run the rule
    // Assert: verify the result
  });

  it("should pass when all parameters are preserved", () => {
    // Arrange / Act / Assert
  });
});
```
